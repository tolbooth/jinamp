# JinAmp: A Simple Audio Player in Java

## General Idea

This project is a simple audio player for listening to your
favorite tunes! Now fleshed out with a Swing GUI and a persistent library!
In the case of this project, I choose to assume the user will only provide uncompressed
MONO .wav files, and not .mp3 simply wrapped as .wav. 

## For Who?

This project is for those looking for a lightweight but
limited audio player, with all the basic functionality one
would expect.

## What's the Point?

An audio player is a perfect project for exploring how pieces
of a software system work together, and is very intuitively
expressed in an object-oriented paradigm.


## Still to Come
- Track scrubbing
- Multiple persistent playlists
