# Simple Audio Player WIP

## General Idea

This project is a simple audio player for listening to your
favorite tunes! Initially working through a terminal based
UI, a basic GUI will be implemented at a later date. Due to
deficiencies with Java's audio format handling, it will only
play a specific set of formats. In the case of this project,
I choose to assume the user will only provide uncompressed
MONO .wav files, and not .mp3 simply wrapped as .wav

## For Who?

This project is for those looking for a lightweight but
limited audio player, with all the basic functionality one
would expect.

## What's the Point?

An audio player is a perfect project for exploring how pieces
of a software system work together, and has is very intuitively
expressed in an object-oriented paradigm.
